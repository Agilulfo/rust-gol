# Game of Life

This is a *brutal* rust implementation of the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

I wrote this just to see if I've actually learned anything after having read the first few chapters of the [rust "book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
